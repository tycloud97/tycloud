Sharing is a way to motivate me. I have 2 year of working in real-work systems in AWS. Get 3 certificated (1 Professional). I hope I can share my working knowledge to everyone.
I have been doing that by sharing my experience to a community group AWS Vietnam. When you scroll, you can see some post of Nguyen Huu Ty.
My experience mainly serverless, monitoring tool like AWS Perpective, and sharing experience get certificated aws. 
I support by comment to post to answer for everyone. By the way I get more realworld knowledge from people in here.
I think it's very good if I have more Credit to build more POC systems and share to everyone more.
Thanks
